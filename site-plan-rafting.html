    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>[We create merch that is for all car enthusiasts, we also post blogs, videos and so much more car related content that goes on around the U.A.E speficialy in Dubai; stay tuned for more to come! As someone who loves cars and knows many others like myself; I think this website would be a great way to share content and build a tiny community in a way with other users where we can share car related things together while giving me the chance to experess my content creation when it comes to videos and articles.]</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>[Our target audience will mainly be folks that love cars, this can range from those you enjoy american muscle, jdm, supercars, suvs and so forth. The audience would be interested in seeing what sort of uniqe products we provide along with the content I would assume, since we are going for a car related theme; I'm thinking maybe doing something with yellow and black would be ideal as it could be associated to Lamborghini which is a very popular car manufacture, as for the fonts I might just stick to something simple like arial. I have an idea for a product that is made from actual crashed supercars and currently working on getting a prototype developed but I did a survey amongs my friends/people at a recent car event which showed that a lot of folks would prefer having either car related clothing or car related keychains which is why I think there is a demand for the product. I want to make my website user friendly, easy to use and available on all platforms.]</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
