									<h1>Growing The Seeds Of Passion & Sharing The Love Of Cars<br />
									</h1>
									<p>For a majority of this semester to my dismay I was stuck at home in my room due to the ongoing pandemic as even though Dubai 
									has eased a number of their restrictions, my mother is absolutely petrified by the virus and its devastating effects and this 
									paranoia and fear results in my brother and I being kept at home like two canaries locked within a cage just chirping away 
									all of our anger and frustration towards our captors for it to just fall on deaf ears. I understand she has our best interests at heart but, I personally think she should be a bit more rational about it as the only few times I was permitted to leave the premises of my house was either to go to the store or on certain weekends where I had to beg them to allow me to go for certain events, meeting with friends but such occasions like this were very rare.</p>
									
									<p>Half-way through the semester the number of COVID-19 cases were rising in Dubai which made the option of me leaving home for fun activities even more inaccessible. I was only allowed to go to the store one in a while to pick up snacks and groceries, which as you could imagine wasn’t much entertainment, but it was undoubtedly better than nothing. I would just take my car that being a Mustang to the store which was about an 8-minute drive from my house, I adore this car and even have the tendency to treat it like my own child at times, which can seem rather weird or annoying to some people, but it doesn’t bother me what they think. During one of my grocery trips, I had noticed a small group of children watching me and my car as I drove by; their group consisted of about 5-8 boys all on their bicycles almost like a group of rebel biker kids. I remember laughing to myself in the car that day, not long after locking eyes with one of the children, he had given me a hand gesture of which looked like he was saying “floor it” or “rev it” and obviously me being the foolish person that I am and not wanting to disappoint him, I ended up flooring it and making quite the ruckus in a neighborhood area where the speed limit was 20 Km.</p>

									<p>They came over to thank me for doing what I did that day, as it seemed that a few of them like myself are obsessed with cars and mainly with American muscle. Which genuinely shocked me as they had a very good understanding on the mechanics, power values, torque, horsepower and so much more on what my car was putting out, which was impressive as many of them were about 6-8 years old. After a while we had some great conversations about cars and even went into talking about how they all either wanted Mustangs, Camaros or Hellcats when they grew up, even though at times it was childish I actually enjoyed it and after showing them around the car, I offered each of them some quick rides in which I maintained all the speed limits and ensured not to make too much noise.</p>

									<p>After all this, while driving back home I had a flash-back of when I was a child and how every time, I had seen cars such as Lamborghinis, Ferraris and so forth. I always imagined what it would be like to experience such a car as a passenger and without even realizing it, I had given these kids a great moment to experience their favorite car or at the very least a fun car that they either enjoyed or respected. I’m a firm believer in sharing with others, especially when you’re in a position to do so. Whether it be food, toys, cars and anything else, you never know how something of yours which you might take for granted could be a goal or even highly soughed by another person and honestly, I remember how when I was 16 years old, I had spotted a Lamborghini Gallardo in front of my building as the owner had presumably gone to the shop or maybe parked it there while visiting a friend. I was recording on my little Go-Pro the outside of the car just literarily drooling at its glory as this was my dream car and still is to this day.</p>

									<p>While recording the owner had come to his car and me being the shy teenager that I had asked him about the car explaining how it was my dream car and such. I remember how excited I was when he let me sit in it and allowed me to film it and even after that offered to give me a quick round in it. That memory is still burned into my head, as its moments like that I will never forget what joy someone can feel when it comes to having experienced their goals and I want to ensure that every opportunity that I have to share such an experience with someone whether it be in a Mustang or even in a Lamborghini, there’s nothing better than making someone’s day like that no matter what hardship you go through; seeing another person’s happiness is awesome.</p>
