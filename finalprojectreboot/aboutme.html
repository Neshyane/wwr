									<h1>A Bit About Myself<br />
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images copy/nesh-headshot.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
								<p>I'm currently 22 years old and attending Brigham Young University of Idaho in pursuit of my bacholors degree in Bussiness Managment along side a minor in Marketing and lastly a cluster in CIT.</p>
								<p>As you could have already seen by my website, I am incredibly passionate about all things automotive especially to do with cars, which is why I want to pursue a career in the automotive field mainly in terms of content creation and events as I have been doing it ever since I was about 16.</p>
								<p>I have been obsessed with cars ever since I can remember, I was growing up my dad would always show me cars on the road and considering that I was born and raised in the city of Dubai; a place considered very wealthy and tends to have quite a large number of exotic cars, needless to say I was incredibly blessed to not only see these cars but also be able to grow up around them.</p>
								<p>As mentioned above I mainly we got into the automotive scene here in Dubai at the age of 16 after high school, as I tend to be quite an extroverted person and love talking to people; I was fortunate enough to meet like-minded individuals who shared the same passion as myself when it came to cars and through a lot of planning and hard work we decided to start a car club which is known as Team Schnell, in which I was the co-founder/events coordinator and it certainly thanks to my experience of nearly four years in the car club I was able to not only grow my network but also learn a lot about operation management as I was always responsible for planning out the drive routes, speaking to venues such as hotels and getting deals for the clubs so that we would have F&B provided to us after we reached the location along with various other tasks.</p>
								<p>I had to resign from my position as in 2019 I was prepare myself to attend university in the US and I did not see how I could benefit the club while being on the other side of the world, even though I'm no longer in the admin team I'm still considered the co-founder and I still attend events while I'm in town.</p>
