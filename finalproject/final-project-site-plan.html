    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Hi there, my name is Nesh and welcome to portfolio website, the purpose for is website is to present my previous work that I have completed with companies that I have partnered with in the past or even my own personal vlogs/content creation. I plan to use this website when presenting my services to future companies or individuals that I plan on working with especially when it comes to my content creation aspect of things as I tend to do a lot of videography and photography and the automotive field.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>As stated above my ideal target audience would be towards automotive companies based in the UAE and the US as these are the two locations I am primarily located in for the most part of the year, since I tend to be a smaller content creator when compared to larger influencers that are located around these locations I would want to stand out in a sense that companies or individuals would understand that this is my personal branding and I only create content for their companies without expectations of any sort of payment or revenue as I'm doing this to build up my own personal brand and in a sense it would be free marketing for them as Cars are my passion and content creation is a hobby of mine.</p>

    <h4>Why Will People Come To Your site?</h4>
    <p>My aim when it comes to traffic/visitors viewing my website would be that either, they are a part of a company or organization that is viewing my content and potentially looking to partner with me for a project, which is why I want to include various types of content that I produce such as the articles, vlogs, photography and so much more. While on the other hand if the visitor is not a part of that target audience, I would assume that these would be people that are curious about what my website provides especially considering that I will be advertising this website on all my social media platforms so it will surely gain a bit of traffic from these sources.</p>

    <h5>What Questions Will Your Visitors Expect Your Site To Answer For Them?</h5>
    <p>The goal of my website would be to show visitors what services I can offer to their company or business, specifically in the automotive industry as that is my target audience and with the content that I have on the website; I would hope that visitors can get a rough idea of what my services can provide for them and will hopefully get in contact with me to learn or inquire more about how I can help them.</p>

    <h6>What Types Of Activities Will Visitors Want To Complete On Your Site?</h6>
    <p>For starters if they are an interested party, I do want to include an e-mail list option where they can provide their contact details to which I can send them an e-mail later on if they tend to be too busy to contact me personally, otherwise I would want visitor to interact with the content that I have on the website such as the videos and the articles.</p>

    <h7>What Information Is Necessary To Complete Any Actions Your Site Offers?</h7>
    <p>As stated above the main actions aside from the visitors interacting with the content on the page would be them signing up for an e-mail list, so the information that they would have to provide would mainly just be their name, phone number, e-mail, and company.</p>

    <h8>Why Will Your Visitors Come To Your Site Instead of Another To Get This Information Or Complete The Actions?</h8>
    <p>Since this website will be mainly used as a manner for me to promote my services, unless the interested parties were to contact me on my own personal social media platforms; they would not be able to gain the information that they need nor would they be able to see all of my content because I don't publish any of my articles elsewhere except for the previous companies that have them on their websites, as for the videos those tend to only be on YouTube.</p>

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/ffdc64-2b2d42-04c863-edf2f4-ef233c"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/ffdc64-2b2d42-04c863-edf2f4-ef233c</a>

    <table class="colors">

      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">[#2b2d42]</td>
