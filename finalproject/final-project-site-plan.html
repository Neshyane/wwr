    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Hi there, my name is Nesh and welcome to portfolio website, the purpose for is website is to present my previous work that I have completed with companies that I have partnered with in the past or even my own personal vlogs/content creation. I plan to use this website when presenting my services to future companies or individuals that I plan on working with especially when it comes to my content creation aspect of things as I tend to do a lot of videography and photography and the automotive field.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>As stated above my ideal target audience would be towards automotive companies based in the UAE and the US as these are the two locations I am primarily located in for the most part of the year, since I tend to be a smaller content creator when compared to larger influencers that are located around these locations I would want to stand out in a sense that companies or individuals would understand that this is my personal branding and I only create content for their companies without expectations of any sort of payment or revenue as I'm doing this to build up my own personal brand and in a sense it would be free marketing for them as Cars are my passion and content creation is a hobby of mine.</p>

You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->
